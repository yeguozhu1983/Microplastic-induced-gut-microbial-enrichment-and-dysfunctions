Data for microplastic-induced gut microbial enrichment and dysfunctions.
We employed stool metagenomics to decipher microplastic-induced selective enrichment characteristics of gut microbiota. Concurrently, unique metabolic disorders in gut microbiota were investigated at the gene level. Subsequently, stool metabolomics was used to analyze and verify microplastic-induced distinctive metabolic disorders in gut microbiota, and to identify key metabolic pathways and potential intervention targets.
